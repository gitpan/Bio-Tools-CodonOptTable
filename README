Bio-Tools-CodonOptTable

A codon quality check tool, it produces a Codon Optimization table to see the quality of each codon.

The simplest way of depiction is to plot the codon usage frequency that can be found in common codon usage tables. A more elaborate way to depict the codon quality is to convert the codon usage frequency into relative adaptiveness values. In contrast to the codon usage frequency the relative adaptiveness takes into account the number of codons which code for the respective amino acid.

We produces each codon frequency, Relative Synonymous Codons Uses and Relative Adaptiveness of a Codon that can help to calculate the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) of a gene.

We generate a Graph between RSCU & RAC for better analysis.

USES or Examples

You can use this module in the following ways

use Bio::Tools::CodonOptTable;

# first method
my $seqobj = Bio::Tools::CodonOptTable->new ( -seq => 'ATGGGGTGGGCACCATGCTGCTGTCGTGAATTTGGGCACGATGGTGTACGTGCTCGTAGCTAGGGTGGGTGGTTTG',
				   -id  => 'GeneFragment-12',
				   -accession_number => 'MYSEQ1',
				   -alphabet => 'dna',
				   -is_circular => 1
				   );

#IF you have sequence in file you can use this method
my $seqobj = Bio::Tools::CodonsUses->new(-file => "contig.fasta",
                                         -format => 'Fasta');

#If you have NCBI accession number and what file from NCBI use this
my $seqobj = Bio::Tools::CodonsUses->new(-ncbi_id => "J00522");

my $myCodons = $seqobj->rscu_rac_table();

if($myCodons)
    {
        for my $each_aa (@$myCodons)
	{
	    print "Codon      : ",$each_aa->[1]->{'codon'},"\t";
	    print "Frequency  : ",$each_aa->[1]->{'frequency'},"\t";
	    print "AminoAcid  : ",$each_aa->[1]->{'aa_name'},"\t";
	    print "RSCU Value : ",$each_aa->[1]->{'rscu'},"\t"; #Relative Synonymous Codons Uses
	    print "RAC Value  : ",$each_aa->[1]->{'rac'},"\t"; #Relative Adaptiveness of a Codon
	    print "\n";
	}
    }
# to generate a Graph between RSCU & RAC
$seqobj->generate_graph($myCodons,"myoutput.gif");
